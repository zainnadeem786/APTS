# Conformance Claim Example

Informative Appendix Example (non-normative)

This example shows how a platform operator might complete the [Conformance Claim Template](../Conformance_Claim_Template.md). The organization, platform, evidence identifiers, and dates are fictional. This example is intentionally partial: it illustrates one possible level of detail and traceability without implying that every operator must use the same wording, evidence structure, or publication format.

Use this example with the [Conformance Claim Template](../Conformance_Claim_Template.md), [Conformance Claim Schema](../Conformance_Claim_Schema.md), [Checklists](../Checklists.md), and [Evidence Package Manifest](../Evidence_Package_Manifest.md).

## Foundation Model Disclosure (APTS-TP-021)

| Field | Example Value |
|-------|---------------|
| **Provider** | ExampleAI Provider |
| **Model Family** | Example Reasoning Model |
| **Model Version or Identifier** | `example-reasoning-2026-03-15` |
| **Release Date** | 2026-03-15 |
| **Fine-Tunes or Adapters** | None |
| **Capability Baseline Reference** | `capability-baseline-2026-04-01.pdf` |
| **Last Re-attestation Date (APTS-TP-022)** | Initial claim |
| **Next Scheduled Review** | 2026-07-20 or earlier on model substitution |

ExampleCorp does not permit runtime model substitution outside the approved model allowlist. Emergency model changes require security review, audit logging, and customer notification when they affect active engagements.

## Domain Summary

The table below is illustrative. A real claim can use the current requirement counts for the claimed APTS version and attach the completed checklist used during assessment.

| Domain | Requirements at Claimed Tier | Met | Example Notes |
|--------|------------------------------|-----|---------------|
| Scope Enforcement (SE) | Tier 1 + Tier 2 applicable requirements | All applicable tier requirements met | RoE validation, deny lists, temporal enforcement, scope refresh, and credential lifecycle controls reviewed |
| Safety Controls (SC) | Tier 1 + Tier 2 applicable requirements | All applicable tier requirements met | Kill switch, rate limiting, cumulative impact thresholds, rollback, and platform health monitoring demonstrated in staging |
| Human Oversight (HO) | Tier 1 + Tier 2 applicable requirements | All applicable tier requirements met | Approval gates, escalation paths, stale approval expiry, and reviewer qualification records sampled |
| Graduated Autonomy (AL) | Tier 1 + Tier 2 applicable requirements | All applicable tier requirements met | L1-L3 operating modes documented; L4 excluded from this claim |
| Auditability (AR) | Tier 1 + Tier 2 applicable requirements | All applicable tier requirements met | Decision logs, evidence hashes, model version logs, and tamper-evident storage reviewed |
| Manipulation Resistance (MR) | Tier 1 + Tier 2 applicable requirements | All applicable tier requirements met | Prompt/data separation, scope anchor validation, adversarial input handling, and red-team test summaries reviewed |
| Supply Chain Trust (TP) | Tier 1 + Tier 2 applicable requirements | All applicable tier requirements met | Provider due diligence, dependency inventory, tenant isolation, retention, and deletion evidence reviewed |
| Reporting (RP) | Tier 1 + Tier 2 applicable requirements | All applicable tier requirements met | Finding validation, confidence scoring, evidence integrity, and downstream export controls sampled |
| **Total** | Tier 2 cumulative requirements | All applicable tier requirements met | Completed checklist reference: `apts-checklist-tier2-examplecorp-2026-04-20.xlsx` |

> **Reminder:** A tier claim requires every MUST requirement at the claimed tier and all lower tiers to be implemented, with no deviation. Every SHOULD requirement at those tiers must be either implemented or recorded in the SHOULD Deviations section with a documented justification; an undocumented SHOULD deviation is a conformance gap.

---

## SHOULD Deviations

None. All SHOULD requirements at Tier 1 and Tier 2 are implemented; no deviations are claimed.

---

## Advisory Requirements (Optional)

| Advisory Requirement | Implemented | Example Notes |
|---------------------|-------------|---------------|
| APTS-TP-A01 external tool connector trust boundaries | Yes | MCP-style connector configuration is isolated per customer engagement and reviewed before enablement |
| APTS-HO-A01 out-of-band kill switch authority | Partial | Documented for production engagements; not enabled for all non-production engagements |

Advisory practices are not counted toward the claimed tier. Clear labels for partial advisory implementation help customers distinguish advisory practices from tier-required controls.

---

## Evidence Availability

ExampleCorp states that the following evidence is available to customers under NDA or through the customer trust portal:

- Completed APTS Tier 2 checklist with per-requirement status
- Sample Rules of Engagement validation report
- Kill switch demonstration recording from staging
- Sample audit log excerpt with sensitive values redacted
- Evidence package manifest for one representative finding
- Human review record for one critical finding
- Model version and capability baseline record
- Data retention and deletion procedure summary
- Independent internal review sign-off memo

Evidence package references:

| Evidence ID | Description | Related APTS Areas |
|-------------|-------------|--------------------|
| `EVID-SE-001` | RoE schema validation and signed scope record | APTS-SE-001, APTS-SE-004, APTS-SE-015 |
| `EVID-SC-009` | Kill switch test recording and result log | APTS-SC-009, APTS-HO-008, APTS-AR-001 |
| `EVID-AR-010` | Tamper-evident audit log hash sample | APTS-AR-010, APTS-AR-012 |
| `EVID-RP-002` | Human review record for critical finding | APTS-RP-002, APTS-HO-010 |
| `EVID-TP-021` | Foundation model disclosure and capability baseline | APTS-TP-021, APTS-TP-022 |

---

## Declared Scope Boundaries

ExampleCorp declares the following boundaries for this fictional claim:

- The platform does not support L4 Autonomous operation under this claim
- Customer-hosted workers are excluded because deployment hardening is customer-controlled
- Production testing requires explicit RoE authorization and Tier 2 safety controls
- Scanner workers cannot initiate lateral movement outside the approved target inventory
- Credential collection is disabled by default and requires customer-approved handling rules

These boundaries describe the claim's scope. They do not remove requirements that remain applicable to the claimed deployment.

---

## Sample Requirement-Level Traceability

This abbreviated table shows one way to connect the high-level claim to requirement-level evidence. A real claim can replace these fictional evidence IDs with the operator's completed checklist outputs and evidence package references.

| Requirement | Example Status | Evidence Reference | Reviewer Note |
|-------------|----------------|--------------------|---------------|
| APTS-SE-001 | Met | `EVID-SE-001` | RoE schema validation and signature checks were sampled for one staging and one production engagement |
| APTS-SC-009 | Met | `EVID-SC-009` | Kill switch demonstration showed graceful termination followed by forced stop on timeout |
| APTS-RP-002 | Met | `EVID-RP-002` | Critical finding review record included reviewer identity, decision, timestamp, and evidence references |

---

## Example Customer Interpretation

A customer reviewing this claim should treat it as an operator-provided statement, not a certification. Reasonable follow-up steps include:

1. Compare the claim to the completed [Checklists](../Checklists.md) for the claimed tier
2. Request a small evidence pack using the [Evidence Request Checklist](../Evidence_Request_Checklist.md)
3. Review one representative [Evidence Package Manifest](../Evidence_Package_Manifest.md)
4. Ask for a vendor demonstration of behavioral controls such as kill switch and scope enforcement
5. Check whether the evidence shows that network actions were checked against the active RoE
6. Confirm that approval authorities, default-deny behavior, and escalation paths are documented
7. Verify that one reported finding can be traced from action to report with preserved evidence
8. Use [Customer Acceptance Testing](../Customer_Acceptance_Testing.md) for higher-assurance deployments
