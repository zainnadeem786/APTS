# Compliance Matrix

Informative Appendix (non-normative)

This appendix is part of the OWASP Autonomous Penetration Testing Standard (APTS) and provides a cross-reference mapping of APTS requirements to major regulatory frameworks and standards. Use this matrix to understand how APTS controls align with external compliance frameworks. It is intended for both external reviewers mapping a vendor or service-provider platform against known frameworks, and enterprise security teams running an internal autonomous pentest platform who need to position APTS conformance against their existing governance program (SOC 2, ISO 27001, NIST CSF, and so on). Note: This mapping identifies areas of overlap and does not constitute legal advice or guarantee compliance with any external regulation. APTS requirements are often more specific to autonomous pentesting than external frameworks; compliance with APTS does not automatically mean compliance with mapped frameworks, and vice versa.

> **Note:** Mappings in this matrix identify areas where APTS requirements address concerns within external frameworks. A mapping does NOT constitute full compliance with the external framework. Organizations should perform their own compliance assessments for each applicable framework independently of APTS.

## Overview

This appendix maps APTS requirements to nine external frameworks, in the order they appear below:
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0** - Risk-based cybersecurity framework
- **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** - International information security standard
- **SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria (2017, with 2022 revised points of focus)** - Trust services for service organizations
- **NIST AI RMF 1.0** - AI risk management framework
- **PCI DSS 4.0.1** - Payment card industry data security standard
- **GDPR** - EU General Data Protection Regulation
- **NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5** - Federal information security controls
- **HIPAA Security Rule (45 CFR Part 164)** - Healthcare data security requirements
- **CIS Critical Security Controls v8** - Foundational security practices

The first four frameworks are mapped comprehensively across all domains. PCI DSS 4.0.1, GDPR, and HIPAA mappings apply primarily to data-handling, privacy, and supply chain requirements. NIST SP 800-53, CIS Controls, and other frameworks address specific governance and technical control areas.

Each framework requires specific controls. The standard's requirements often address areas relevant to multiple framework controls simultaneously.

## Using This Matrix

1. **For Audits**: Use matrix to show compliance with standards
2. **For Vendor Reviews**: Map vendor requirements to APTS controls
3. **For Gap Analysis**: Identify which APTS controls address which framework requirements
4. **For Client Assurance**: Demonstrate how APTS controls align with client compliance requirements

---

## Key Observations

1. **NIST CSF 2.0 Coverage**: The standard addresses all six functions (Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover)
2. **ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Coverage**: Controls A.5 through A.8 have corresponding mappings
3. **SOC 2 Coverage**: All five trust services categories addressed with proper Trust Services Criteria codes
4. **NIST AI RMF 1.0 Coverage**: All four functions (Govern, Map, Measure, Manage) addressed, with particular depth in autonomy governance and AI risk treatment
5. **PCI DSS Coverage**: Applicable controls for card data security
6. **GDPR Coverage**: All key articles (5, 17, 28, 32-34) addressed
