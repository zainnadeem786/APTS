# Vendor Evaluation Guide

Informative Appendix (non-normative)

This appendix helps customers (CISOs, procurement teams, and security leaders) evaluate autonomous pentesting platform operators against APTS requirements. Throughout this guide, "the operator" refers to whichever entity operates the platform being evaluated: an external vendor, a managed-service provider, or an internal enterprise security team. Enterprise teams performing self-evaluation should use the questions as a self-review checklist before publishing an internal conformance claim.

For a shorter first-pass screen before a deeper review, see the [Quick Vendor Review Checklist](Quick_Vendor_Review_Checklist.md).

## Before You Start

Decide your minimum compliance tier based on your risk tolerance:

- **Tier 1 (Foundation):** 72 requirements. The platform will not test outside the agreed scope, can be stopped immediately, will not leak discovered credentials, and provides a basic audit trail. **Choose Tier 1 when:** you are running supervised autonomous testing against non-critical systems with experienced operators monitoring the engagement.

- **Tier 2 (Verified):** 157 cumulative requirements (72 + 85). The platform is fully transparent about what it did and why, protects your data with tamper-proof audit trails, handles incidents with formal response procedures, and provides independently verifiable findings. **Choose Tier 2 when:** you are testing production environments, operating in regulated industries, or need full accountability for audit or compliance purposes. This is the recommended minimum for most production deployments.

- **Tier 3 (Comprehensive):** 173 cumulative requirements (157 + 16). The platform meets the highest assurance bar for critical infrastructure, fully autonomous (L4) operations, and the strictest regulatory requirements. **Choose Tier 3 when:** you are deploying fully autonomous testing against critical infrastructure, financial systems, or healthcare environments with minimal human oversight. An additional 19 advisory practices in the [Advisory Requirements appendix](Advisory_Requirements.md) are recommended for highest-assurance engagements but are not counted toward any tier.

> **Minimum tier guidance:** Tier 1 is appropriate for supervised testing of non-critical systems in non-regulated environments. Organizations in financial services, healthcare, critical infrastructure, or any regulated industry SHOULD require Tier 2 as a minimum. Tier 3 is recommended for critical infrastructure, fully autonomous (L4) operations, and environments with the strictest regulatory requirements.

## Domain-by-Domain Evaluation

Use the questions below to evaluate vendor capabilities across all eight APTS domains. Not every question applies to every engagement; select those relevant to your environment and risk tolerance. For brevity, requirement IDs in the tables below use the short form (for example, SE-001) rather than the full identifier (APTS-SE-001).

## What to Ask Vendors

Use these seven questions for initial assessment before detailed evaluation:

1. **"Which APTS tier do you claim conformance with?"** If unfamiliar with APTS, share this standard. If claiming conformance, request evidence.

2. **"Provide your completed APTS conformance assessment against the [Checklists](Checklists.md)."** A credible vendor maps capabilities to per-tier verification items, whether the assessment was performed internally or by a third party.

3. **"Can you demonstrate your safety controls in a live environment?"** Ask the vendor to demonstrate kill switch operation, scope enforcement, and rate limiting. The [Customer Acceptance Testing](Customer_Acceptance_Testing.md) appendix provides structured test procedures if you want to conduct your own hands-on verification.

4. **"How does your kill switch work, and can we test it?"** Multiple independent kill switches are required (APTS-SC-009). Ask for a demo in a test environment.

5. **"What happens to our data after the engagement?"** Request credential disposal reports and data destruction proof (APTS-SE-023, APTS-TP-015, APTS-TP-016).

6. **"Do you deploy agents or software to our infrastructure?"** If yes, confirm agents can be removed without vendor cooperation and are covered in the Rules of Engagement (APTS-SE-022).

7. **"What AI/ML models does the platform use, and how do you track model changes?"** Request the model change log and drift detection procedures (APTS-AR-019).

## Red Flags

Watch for these warning signs:

- **No kill switch demo.** Inability to demonstrate emergency termination may indicate the capability doesn't exist or won't work reliably.
- **"We handle scope internally."** Platforms must accept machine-parseable RoE from customers, not define scope unilaterally.
- **No audit trail access.** Refusal to provide logs suggests insufficient logging infrastructure.
- **Vague AI model governance.** Vendors should know exactly which models are used, how changes are tracked, and how drift is detected.
- **No data isolation.** Engagement data from different customers must be isolated; ask how this is enforced.
- **No credential rotation.** Inability to confirm automatic credential disposal at engagement end risks stale credentials persisting.
- **No incident notification timeline.** Vendors should have documented timelines for customer notification of security incidents.

### Evaluation Timeline

A thorough vendor evaluation typically requires 2-4 weeks depending on the depth of verification:

- **Week 1:** Define target tier. Distribute the APTS Checklists appendix to the vendor and request a completed conformance assessment. Review vendor documentation.
- **Week 2:** Vendor presentation and Q&A using domain-specific evaluation questions above. Request evidence for claimed capabilities. Request vendor demonstrations of safety controls (kill switch, scope enforcement, rate limiting).
- **Week 3-4 (optional):** If additional assurance is needed, conduct hands-on verification using the [Customer Acceptance Testing](Customer_Acceptance_Testing.md) procedures in a staging environment. Analyze results, identify gaps, make accept/conditional/reject decision.

## Verification Approaches

Three approaches, in increasing order of assurance:

- **Vendor-provided conformance assessment:** Vendor provides a completed checklist with supporting evidence. The assessment may be performed internally or by a third party at the vendor's discretion. This is the standard starting point for evaluating vendor claims against APTS requirements. Most vendor evaluations will use this approach.
- **Vendor demonstration:** Ask the vendor to demonstrate key safety controls (kill switch activation, scope enforcement, rate limiting) in their own staging environment. This provides additional confidence in behavioral requirements without requiring the customer to build test infrastructure.
- **Customer Acceptance Testing (CAT):** For organizations requiring the highest assurance (critical infrastructure, regulated industries, fully autonomous deployments), the [Customer Acceptance Testing](Customer_Acceptance_Testing.md) appendix provides structured hands-on test procedures. CAT is optional and represents the most thorough verification approach.

> **Note on behavioral requirements:** Some APTS requirements are behavioral (kill switch timing, scope enforcement accuracy, manipulation resistance) and cannot be fully verified through documentation. For these requirements, customers can request vendor demonstrations or recorded evidence. Organizations with higher risk tolerance may accept vendor claims and operator-provided assessment evidence; organizations requiring stronger assurance may conduct hands-on verification using the CAT procedures.

## Recommended Evaluation Process

1. **Define your minimum tier.** Tier 1 for general use, Tier 2 for regulated environments, Tier 3 for highest-assurance requirements.
2. **Send the vendor the APTS Checklists** for their claimed tier and request a completed conformance assessment.
3. **Request a small evidence pack first.** The [Evidence Request Checklist](Evidence_Request_Checklist.md) appendix provides a lightweight starting set of artifacts to request before deeper review.
4. **Review domain-specific questions** from the tables above, prioritizing domains most relevant to your environment.
5. **Identify red flags** using the criteria above. Any red flag warrants deeper investigation before proceeding.
6. **Request vendor demonstrations** of key safety controls (kill switch, scope enforcement, rate limiting). For higher-assurance needs, consider conducting [Customer Acceptance Testing](Customer_Acceptance_Testing.md).
7. **Document the evaluation outcome** including tier, date, and any conditions or exceptions.
8. **Re-evaluate periodically** or when major platform changes, security incidents, or autonomy level changes occur.
