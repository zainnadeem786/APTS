## Document Conventions

This standard uses RFC 2119 language:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **MUST** | Mandatory requirement. No deviation is permitted for a tier claim. |
| **MUST NOT** | Absolute prohibition. |
| **SHOULD** | Recommended. Deviation requires documented justification. |
| **SHOULD NOT** | Not recommended. Deviation is acceptable with documented justification. |
| **MAY** | Optional. Implementation is at the organization's discretion. |
| **OPTIONAL** | Truly discretionary. May be included based on organizational needs. |

A requirement's classification (MUST or SHOULD, shown in its Requirement Index entry) sets its conformance weight for the tier. Within a requirement's text, sub-clauses may carry their own RFC 2119 keywords describing how the control is implemented. Where a SHOULD-classified requirement contains MUST sub-clauses, those sub-clauses are conditional: they become mandatory only once the organization elects to implement the requirement (or where the requirement's Applicability statement is met). A SHOULD requirement may still be deviated from with documented justification per the conformance rules in the Introduction.
