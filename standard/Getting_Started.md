# Getting Started with APTS

This guide provides a recommended reading order and orientation for new readers of the OWASP Autonomous Penetration Testing Standard. It does not create requirements. All requirements are defined in the domain READMEs.

## Who Is This Standard For?

APTS serves three primary audiences:

- **Platform operators** (vendors, service providers, and enterprise security teams building or running internal platforms). Use APTS to design governance controls into your platform.
- **Customers** (CISOs, procurement teams, and security leaders) evaluating or deploying autonomous pentesting platforms. Use APTS as procurement criteria and ongoing governance requirements.
- **Security professionals** reviewing autonomous pentesting platforms. Use APTS requirements and verification procedures as a reference framework.

## Recommended Reading Order

### Step 1: Understand the Framework

Read the [Introduction](Introduction.md) first. It explains the standard's purpose, the eight domains, and compliance tiers. Pay particular attention to tier definitions, as they drive subsequent decisions.

### Step 2: Know the Vocabulary

Skim the [Glossary](appendix/Glossary.md) to familiarize yourself with APTS-specific terminology. Key terms include the four autonomy levels (L1 Assisted through L4 Autonomous, defined in the Graduated Autonomy domain), the four asset criticality categories (Critical, Production, Non-Production, Unknown, defined in APTS-SE-005), and the distinction between MUST, SHOULD, and MAY per RFC 2119.

### Step 3: Survey the Requirements

Read the [Checklists](appendix/Checklists.md) appendix for your target tier. This provides a compact view of every requirement organized by tier and domain. You do not need to understand each requirement deeply at this stage; the goal is to see the full scope.

### Step 3.5: Understand Cross-Domain Dependencies

Before reading individual domains, skim the [Cross-Domain Integration](appendix/Cross_Domain_Integration.md) appendix. APTS domains are interdependent: a single event (such as a kill-switch activation or a scope violation) can trigger requirements across four or more domains simultaneously. Understanding these dependencies prevents the common mistake of implementing domains in isolation. The appendix includes event-triggered dependency maps, a suggested implementation sequence, and scenario walk-throughs.

### Step 4: Dive into Domains

Read the domain READMEs that are most relevant to your role:

| If You Are... | Start With These Domains |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| A platform architect | Scope Enforcement (SE), Safety Controls (SC), Graduated Autonomy (AL) |
| A security operations lead | Human Oversight (HO), Safety Controls (SC), Auditability (AR) |
| A compliance officer | Auditability (AR), Reporting (RP), Supply Chain Trust (TP); also see [Compliance Matrix](appendix/Compliance_Matrix.md) for regulatory framework mappings |
| A CISO evaluating vendors or an internal platform | All domains via [Vendor Evaluation Guide](appendix/Vendor_Evaluation_Guide.md) |
| An enterprise security team building an internal autonomous pentest platform | All domains. Start with Scope Enforcement (SE), Safety Controls (SC), Human Oversight (HO), then Auditability (AR) |
| A security professional reviewing a platform | Scope Enforcement (SE), Safety Controls (SC), Auditability (AR), Manipulation Resistance (MR), Reporting (RP), then the Verification subsections for the claimed tier |
| An AI/ML engineer | Manipulation Resistance (MR), Graduated Autonomy (AL), Supply Chain Trust (TP) |

Each domain README contains the full normative requirements with rationale and verification procedures. Framework mappings (NIST CSF, ISO 27001, NIST AI RMF, SOC 2, PCI DSS, GDPR) are in the [Compliance Matrix](appendix/Compliance_Matrix.md). Domains are not independent; refer to [Cross-Domain Integration](appendix/Cross_Domain_Integration.md) to understand how requirements in your focused domains connect to others.

### Step 5: Plan Implementation

Each domain includes an Implementation Guide with practical guidance for every requirement. These guides provide implementation approaches, key considerations, and common pitfalls. They are informative (non-normative); the domain READMEs are the authoritative source.

### Step 6: Apply the Standard

Depending on your role:

- **Platform builders (vendors, service providers, and enterprise security teams running internal platforms)**: Assess your platform against your target tier using the [Checklists](appendix/Checklists.md). Use the [Compliance Matrix](appendix/Compliance_Matrix.md) to understand alignment with external frameworks. The verification model and assessment options are described in the [Introduction](Introduction.md#compliance-tiers).
- **Customers**: Use the [Vendor Evaluation Guide](appendix/Vendor_Evaluation_Guide.md) to review operator-provided evidence and conformance assessment claims. For additional assurance, the [Customer Acceptance Testing](appendix/Customer_Acceptance_Testing.md) appendix provides optional hands-on verification procedures.
- **Security professionals**: Identify the claimed tier, deployment model, autonomy level, and platform configuration first. Then use each requirement's Verification subsection to review evidence, record gaps, and identify follow-up questions. Start with the [Vendor Evaluation Guide](appendix/Vendor_Evaluation_Guide.md) when reviewing an operator claim, and use [Customer Acceptance Testing](appendix/Customer_Acceptance_Testing.md) when behavioral evidence is needed for controls such as scope enforcement, kill switches, manipulation resistance, or reporting reproducibility.

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to implement all 173 requirements?**
No. Start with Tier 1 (72 requirements). Tier 2 and Tier 3 add requirements progressively for cumulative totals of 157 and 173. An additional 18 advisory practices live in the [Advisory Requirements appendix](appendix/Advisory_Requirements.md) under the `APTS-<DOMAIN>-A0x` identifier pattern; advisory practices are not required for conformance at any tier. See [Introduction: Compliance Tiers](Introduction.md#compliance-tiers) for details.

**Q: What if my platform meets most but not all Tier 1 requirements?**
APTS does not award partial credit. A platform must meet 100% of requirements for its claimed tier; MUST requirements permit no deviation. At Tier 2 and above, an unimplemented SHOULD requirement does not void the claim if the deviation is documented with justification in the conformance claim. Address MUST gaps before claiming a tier.

**Q: Are the Implementation Guides mandatory?**
No. Implementation Guides are informative. They suggest approaches but do not define requirements. The domain READMEs contain all normative requirements.

**Q: How does APTS relate to PTES, WSTG, or OSSTMM?**
APTS is a governance framework, not a testing methodology. Autonomous systems should follow established testing methodologies (PTES, WSTG, OSSTMM) while operating under APTS governance controls.

**Q: Do I need to get certified?**
No. See the [Introduction](Introduction.md#compliance-tiers) for the full verification model. Platforms are assessed against the requirements, conformance is documented, and customers may independently verify claims using the [Vendor Evaluation Guide](appendix/Vendor_Evaluation_Guide.md).

**Q: When should I re-evaluate against APTS?**
Re-evaluate after major platform changes, security incidents, autonomy level changes, material dependency changes, or when the APTS standard releases a new version. At minimum, re-evaluate annually.

**Q: How much time should I budget for APTS?**
For platform operators (vendors, service providers, and enterprise security teams running internal platforms): plan 2-3 days to read and understand requirements for your target tier, plus 1-2 days per domain for detailed implementation planning. For customers evaluating an external vendor or assessing an internal platform: plan 1-2 weeks using the Vendor Evaluation Guide to review evidence and demonstrations of key safety controls. If conducting optional Customer Acceptance Testing, add 1-2 weeks for test execution and analysis.
