# OWASP Autonomous Penetration Testing Standard

This is the full OWASP Autonomous Penetration Testing Standard. It defines 173 tier-required requirements across 8 domains (plus 19 advisory practices in the [Advisory Requirements appendix](appendix/Advisory_Requirements.md)) that autonomous penetration testing platforms must meet to operate safely, transparently, and within defined boundaries, whether delivered by vendors, operated as a service, or built in-house by enterprise security teams.

## Getting Started

New to APTS? Start with the [Getting Started Guide](./Getting_Started.md) for a recommended reading order and orientation.

## Front Matter

- [Foreword](./Foreword.md) - Why this standard exists
- [Frontispiece](./Frontispiece.md) - Project metadata and conventions
- [Introduction](./Introduction.md) - Purpose, scope, compliance tiers, how to use this standard

## How This Standard Is Organized

Each of the 8 domains has its own folder containing:

- **README.md** - The requirements themselves, each with classification, requirement specification, and verification procedures
- **Implementation_Guide.md** - Practical guidance per requirement (implementation steps, key considerations, common pitfalls) plus a tiered implementation roadmap

The [appendices](./appendix/) provide cross-cutting resources: checklists, compliance mappings, cross-domain integration patterns, and evaluation guides.

## Machine-readable export

A machine-readable JSON export of APTS requirements is available at: [apts_requirements.json](apts_requirements.json)<br>
A JSON schema for validating the export is available at: [apts_requirements_schema.json](apts_requirements_schema.json)

This enables automation, compliance tooling integration, and vendor self-assessment workflows.

### Generating the JSON Export

If you modify the requirements in the Markdown files or add new domains, you can automatically regenerate both the JSON export and its schema by running the export script from the root directory:

```bash
python scripts/export_requirements.py
```
